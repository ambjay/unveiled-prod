# Qloo Integration Guide

Qloo is the backbone of unv3iled's taste prediction engine, providing cultural intelligence and taste analysis.

## What is Qloo?

Qloo is a cultural AI platform that understands taste across entertainment, fashion, food, and travel. It powers the core prediction engine of unv3iled by:

- **Analyzing taste patterns** across multiple domains

## Fallback Strategy

If Qloo is not available, unv3iled falls back to:

1. **Groq AI predictions** using Llama 3.1 70B
2. **Local taste analysis** based on user data
3. **Reduced accuracy** but still functional

## Integration Benefits

With Qloo integration, unv3iled provides:

- **Higher accuracy** predictions (85%+ vs 70% fallback)
- **Cultural context** understanding
- **Cross-domain** recommendations
- **Professional-grade** taste intelligence
- **Reasoning** for all predictions

## Testing Without Qloo

The app works without Qloo but with limited features:
- Basic predictions via Groq
- Simple taste analysis
- No cultural intelligence
- Reduced accuracy

## Cost Considerations

- Qloo typically charges per API call
- Consider caching results to reduce costs
- Batch requests when possible
- Monitor usage in production

## Next Steps

1. **Contact Qloo** for API access
2. **Test integration** in development
3. **Monitor performance** and accuracy
4. **Scale gradually** in production
